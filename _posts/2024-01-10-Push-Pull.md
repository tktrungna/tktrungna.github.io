# Push and Pull models

## Content delivery network
A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. This help to significantly improve performance in two ways:
* Users receive content from data centers close to them
* Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills
#### Push CDNs
Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on source server side. You take full responsibilty for providing content, uploading directly o the CDN and rewriting URLs to point the the CDN. You can configure when content expires and when it is updated. 
* Pros: minimizing traffic, maximizing storage (Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals)
* Cons: need more storage on the CDN

Fits to sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated
#### Pull CDNs
Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content. You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN. This results in a slower request (first ones) until the content is cached on the CDN. A [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) determines how long content is cached. 
* Pros: minimize storage space on the CDN
* Cons: can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed. some negative experience for user for the first request

Fits to site with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.

## Log and metric collect
#### Push Model: Influx/Telegraf/Grafana

The primary disadvantage of pull based methods is that they donâ€™t work well for event-driven time series (like individual requests to an API, or events in your infrastructure). The strength of pull based methods is that any outside system can collect telemetry data from your applications without them sending data to a new service.

### Pull Model: Prometheus/Grafana

We have dedicated metric collectors which pull metrics values from the running applications periodically. 
The pull model is more scalable because it decreases the number of requests going into the metrics databases - there is no hot path and concurrency issue.
